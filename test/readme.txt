Irony of ironies,

I wrote ruby-snarl, to support my testing and it does not have any. 
If you can come up with some useful tests let me know, there is not
much code and it only interfaces with an external system. I suppose 
writing a mock snarl and testing against it, but the issue is how 
do I know if there are bugs in the mock snarl (it would be at least
as complicated as the code I am testing)...
